# Week 2 - To do list challenge

The aim of this challenge was to build a todo list making use of react components.

## Minimum Viable Product:
- An input to enter the text for a to do
- Functionality submit the todo
- The todo should be added to a running list
- The added todo should be rendered on screen along with any todo items already entered
- Once submitted the input should be cleared so the user can add more todo items
- The user should be able to clear the entire list at the click of a button
- If a user tries to add an empty todo, render a warning notification

N.B - The list of todo items does not need to be persisted when the app restarts.

## Ideas to expand (optional):
- Give the user an option to delete specific element
- Give the user the option to mark a Todo as done (ideally this will be visualised this by using the strike though text decoration with a grey font colour e.g. My first todo)
- Implement a success notification to indicate the todo has been added (will need to be visually different from the error notification.  Bonus points for reusing any implementation built for the error notification)
- Implement a max limit (max 10)
- If the user hits the limit, render a notification to let them know
